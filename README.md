## optimisation
various optimisation problems solution (using CVXPy, JAX, etc)
1. Dynamic of spaceship controls:

  a) Find the position, speed and forse in evert timestamp such that the total amount of consumed fuel is minimal (CVXPy is used)
  
  b) Find the minimal time that is sufficient to land the spaceship

2. Nonnegative matrix factorization for image processing: 
##### (NMF has become so popular is because of its ability to automatically extract sparse and easily interpretable factors.)

  a) implement with CVXPy the alternating optimization method
  
  b) plot the convergence line (objective function value vs. iteration idx) and confirm that the method converegs
